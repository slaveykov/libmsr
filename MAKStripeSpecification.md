# Introduction #

The MAKStripe is hardware produced by the fine people at MAKInterface. The MAKStripe does not have a public specification. We have reverse engineered what we believe is a nearly complete specification. We have done this by observing and decoding the raw bytes on the USB bus when driven by their non-free software.

# Specification #

Currently, almost all of the specification details can be found in the MAKStripe header files; we have also written a mostly complete specification that may be <a href='http://code.google.com/p/libmsr/source/browse/trunk/MAKStripe.specification'>found in our subversion repository</a>.

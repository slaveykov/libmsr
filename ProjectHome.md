<hr />

This project is an independent Free Software implementation of the protocol for the MSR 206 magnetic stripe reader/writer. It is intended to be both a library for use in other programs that wish to interface with the MSR 206 and as a collection of useful user space programs.<br>
<br>
The MSR 206 comes in various flavors and can do three track reading and writing of magnetic data. It can write both HiCo and LoCo cards in ISO standard formats or in a raw data mode for specifically tailored data.<br>
<br>
This program will allow you to backup your current magnetic stripe data. In addition as a developer or user, you can interface with raw magnetic stripe data without having to use proprietary software.<br>
<br>
Eventually, this library will support other readers or writers and not just the MSR-206. It currently has partial support for the MAKInterface MAKStripe reader/writer.
